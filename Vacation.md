## Introduction
Nowdays there is lot of daily roitine, a very busy schedule. These factors can make crazy anybode. Thars's why there is a thirty days vacation for every employee every year. But some of employers like to divide thier employees' vacations into parts. I have the same situation. And i'll tell you how I'm going deal with it. 
## Summer Vacation
If it will be possible, i would like to marry my girlfriend on July 2023 and go together to the honeymoon to Turkey. We will sunbathing and swimming. Furthermore, i would like ti visit some historical places.
## Winter Vacation
On winter vacation me and my wife (i hope she will be already in this status) will visit Baikal lake. There are a lot of mountains to the south of Baikal. Furthermore, there is a "Heart" loke to the south of Baikal. I think it will be very romantic.
